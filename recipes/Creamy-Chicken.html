    <p>Can’t find chicken cutlets at your local grocery store? Buy 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds total). Lay the chicken breast flat on your cutting board and use a sharp chef’s knife to cut it in half horizontally. Each chicken breast will give you 2 cutlets.

      Dry white wines I recommend for this recipe: Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, or a dry Riesling.</p>
